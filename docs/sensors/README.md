# Sensor Documentation (Moved)

⚠️ **This directory has been reorganized for better structure.**

## New Location

All sensor documentation has been **moved to** [`docs/hardware/components/`](../hardware/components/README.md)

Sensors are now organized together with all other hardware components for a unified documentation structure.

## Component Links

**Sensors:**
- **[DFRobot C4001 mmWave Radar](../hardware/components/dfrobot-c4001/README.md)**
- **[Panasonic EKMC1604111 PIR Sensor](../hardware/components/panasonic-ekmc1604111/README.md)**
- **[ROHM BH1750FVI Light Sensor](../hardware/components/rohm-bh1750/README.md)**

**Complete Documentation:**
- **[All Hardware Components & GPIO Allocation](../hardware/components/README.md)**

---

**Reason for Move:** Unified structure - all hardware components (sensors, MCUs, ICs) are now documented in one place under `docs/hardware/components/`.

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-01
